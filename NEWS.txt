# Version 0.0.3
+ Refactored some of the reading process for xml file types.
+ Corrected a syntax error in the command line interface.
+ More general exception catching in ActivityData.__getitem__ so as not to interfere with the parent method.
+ Creating a `Gradient` column via the ActivityData.gradient() method was dropping the index. This is fixed.

# Version 0.0.2
+ Support added for *.gpx files.
+ Command line interface added (see `aio -h`).
+ `activityio._util.xml` was clobbering the standard library package in some cases, so was renamed to `activityio._util.xml_reading`
+ Non-code files removed from packages.

# Version 0.0.1
+ Alpha version released.
