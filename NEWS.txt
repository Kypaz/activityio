# Version 0.0.3
+ `ActivityData` has some new methods:
    - The GoldenCheetah/Skiba 'xPower' metric (`xpwr()`)
    - `normwork()` (normalised work), which I've found useful.
    - `pwr_prof()` for power profiling.
+ .fit file timestamps weren't being handled correctly. Now they are.
+ Refactored some of the reading process for xml file types.
+ Corrected a syntax error in the command line interface.
+ More general exception catching in ActivityData.__getitem__ so as not to interfere with the parent method.
+ Creating a `Gradient` column via the `ActivityData.gradient()` method was dropping the index. This is fixed.
+ `ActivityData.resample_1hz()` is gone as it was a bit overkill. Call the `pandas` API instead.
+ Various bug fixes.

# Version 0.0.2
+ Support added for *.gpx files.
+ Command line interface added (see `aio -h`).
+ `activityio._util.xml` was clobbering the standard library package in some cases, so was renamed to `activityio._util.xml_reading`
+ Non-code files removed from packages.

# Version 0.0.1
+ Alpha version released.

___
# TODO:
+ Make sure that `DataFrame` methods on `ActivityData` return an `ActivityData` instance.
+ Make tests executable via `pip`.
